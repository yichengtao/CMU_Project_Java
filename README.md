# CMU_Project_Java
My most significant Java programming project for CMU application

This is the final project of the Brandeis course COSI 180A: Algorithms. We were given the map information of Brandeis (See MapDataEdges.txt and MapDataVertices.txt) and asked to use the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between two user-entered locations on the map according to distance or time. In the project, we were not allowed to use any Java libararies so I implemented data structures like singly linked list, heap, and graph by myself. Several sample results are included in sample_results.zip.
