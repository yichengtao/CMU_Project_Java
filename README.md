# CMU_Project_Java
My most significant Java programming project for CMU application.

This is the final project of the Brandeis course COSI 180A: Algorithms. We were given the map information of Brandeis (See MapDataEdges.txt and MapDataVertices.txt) and asked to use the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between two user-entered locations on the map according to distance or time. In the project, we were not allowed to use any Java libraries so I implemented data structures like singly linked list, heap, and graph by myself. You can run Map.java to see results. Several sample results are provided in Output.txt and sample_routes.zip. The size of the whol project is about 800 lines.
